## Market Basket Analysis

### Project Overview
Accurately predicting sales and inventory is especially important for grocery stores since they are dealing with perishable items. Additionally, not placing or pricing items appropriately could cause lost sales. This project addresses how we can determine what products are frequently purchased together so that we can market them together, plan the most beneficial store placement of products and plan pricing in order to encourage customers to purchase additional products.
