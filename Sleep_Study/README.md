## Sleep Study – How Much Sleep is Enough

### Project Overview
The purpose of this project was to determine how much sleep is generally considered “enough” and why some people seem to function well on less sleep while others get more and still feel tired.  I attempted to determine if there are other factors that contribute to people feeling tired or well rested.  The problem statement addressed is: how much sleep is enough (and what does "enough" really mean) and what factors might contribute to feeling tired or not feeling you got enough sleep.

### Methods used for analysis
Scatterplot and histograms to identify visual trends and correlations
Linear Regression
Logistic Regression
Test/Train Split
Confusion Matrix

### Variables Used
Hours of sleep
Tiredness Rating
